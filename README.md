# printf

This repository contains a custom implementation of the `printf` function in C, which meets the specifications outlined in the project requirements. The `printf` function is a widely used standard library function in C that performs formatted output. The objective of this project is to develop a simplified version of this function.

## Task 0
Write a function that produces output according to a format.

- Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
- Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
- write output to stdout, the standard output stream
- format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
	 - c
	 - s
	 - %
- You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function
- You don’t have to handle the flag characters
- You don’t have to handle field width
- You don’t have to handle precision
- You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

## Task 1

Handle the following conversion specifiers:
- d
- i
- You don’t have to handle the flag characters
- You don’t have to handle field width
- You don’t have to handle precision
- You don’t have to handle the length modifiers
