 * This function appends the specified character to the buffer and checks if
 * the buffer has reached its maximum size (BUFFERSIZE). If the buffer is full,
 * it displays the content of the buffer and resets the count. Otherwise, it
 * simply appends the character to the buffer and increments the count.
